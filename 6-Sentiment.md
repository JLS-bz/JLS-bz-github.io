# To do

End product:
1. Bar charts showing top most common positive and negative words in a subreddit, words associated with a specific word, i.e. like, feel, not, with x axis as sentiment value.
2. Charts specific to each subreddit.
3. Charts comparing the use of similar words used in different subreddits.
4. Compare sentiment lexicons/dictionaries, domain specific vs AFINN vs bing vs NRC.

Steps:
1. Figure out and adapt [socialsent code](https://github.com/williamleif/socialsent) example.
2. Create domain specific sentiment lexicons/dictionaries for each subreddit group.
3. Perform sentiment analysis - looking at units beyond just words, sentiment of sentence.
4. Visualize sentiment analysis output with plotnine
